# Hello

This is a paragraph.

- Top short
- Top long item that will wrap across lines to check hanging indent at level one. This keeps going so it wraps again for clarity in an 80-column layout used by tests.
    - Child short
    - Child long item that will also *wrap across lines* so we can verify level two hanging indent behaves correctly when the text is long enough to wrap.
        - Grandchild long item that wraps to ensure level three hanging indent also aligns properly under its text and stays readable across multiple lines.
          - Another grandchild long item that wraps to ensure level four hanging indent also aligns properly under its text and stays readable across multiple lines.
- Final top item

## Life goals

1. Chop wood. Wood is a structural tissue/material found as xylem in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants.
2. Carry water

Now let's try some tasks.

- [x] Buy eggs. Lots of eggs, so many that this task gets really long, long enough to wrap, and we can see that there's a hanging indent.  
- [ ] Write some code

The end.
